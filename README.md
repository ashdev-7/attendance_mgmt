### Attendance Management System

The Attendance Management System is a simple database-driven solution built with Oracle SQL and PL/SQL for managing employee attendance, 
leave requests, and payroll. The system tracks employee attendance (clock-in and clock-out), processes leave requests, and calculates 
payroll based on hours worked. It also includes stored procedures and triggers to automate payroll calculation and attendance management.

Features
Employee Attendance Tracking: Automatically logs clock-in and clock-out times for employees.
Leave Request Management: Tracks employee leave requests with statuses (e.g., Pending, Approved).
Payroll Calculation: Calculates payroll based on hours worked, salary, and other deductions.
Automated Operations: Utilizes stored procedures to automate payroll calculation and attendance recording.
Data Integrity: Ensures data consistency and accuracy using triggers to automatically update payroll when attendance is registered.
